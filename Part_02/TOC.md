### Chapter 04 
- TODOs
    - [x] The **exec order** in an expression
    - [x] The **bitwise operators**
    - [x] Defining **new type** & limits its possible values 
    - [x] Defining **alternative names** for existing data types
    - [ ] The **storage duration of a variable** & what determines it
    - [ ] The **variable scope** & what its effects are 
- Note
    - I skipped the *exec order* since it's too easy.
    - I skipped the *bitwise opts* since it's not that helpful to me.
